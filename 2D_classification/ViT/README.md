First you should follow [My Dataset Guidance](https://github.com/tungyen/Deep_learning_CV/tree/master/Dataset) to download the flower dataset.


## training ##
```bash
python train.py
```

## evaluation ##
To be continue

## testing ##
```bash
python predict.py
```

Now the code only predict the result based on 1 single image. The code for predict a batch of image will be released soon.
